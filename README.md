#Garfield Comic Downloader

The Garfield Comic Downloader script downloads all the Garfield comics from 19th June, 1978. The comics will be stored in garfield folder, which is created in the directory where the script is run.

The only library which is required is URLLib2, which by default should come with your python installation. I have tested the script with Mac OS X, running python 2.7.6; Its very likely that it will work with other operating systems.

To run the script
```shell
python garfield.py
```
